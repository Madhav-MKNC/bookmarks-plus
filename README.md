# BONUS

***If you don't want to install a chrome extension and use a Github hosted static app instead:***

[saved-stuff.github.io](saved-stuff.github.io)

## **Note** for Non-Techies

Both the apps (chrome extension and github hosted app) are completely safe and secure (open source). Both use your Chrome Browser's *localStorage* for storing your stuff and since they both are just simple static apps you don't need to worry about any leaks. **NOTHING LIKE THAT EXISTS**. Just a locally hosted app.
