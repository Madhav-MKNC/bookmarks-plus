Introduction

Bookmarks-plus is a Chrome extension designed to help users manage their bookmarks efficiently by allowing them to categorize, tag, and add notes to their saved links. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, store, and protect your data while using the extension.

Data We Collect

Bookmarks-plus is designed with your privacy in mind. The only data we collect are the bookmarks, categories, tags, and notes that you manually input or add while using the extension. We do not collect or track any personal information such as browsing history, IP addresses, or personal identifiers.

How We Use Your Data

The data you provide through Bookmarks-plus, such as bookmarks, categories, tags, and notes, are used exclusively for managing and organizing your bookmarks within the extension. This data is stored locally on your device, meaning it never leaves your computer or is sent to external servers.

Local Data Storage

All data associated with your bookmarks, including categories, tags, and notes, is stored locally on your device in the form of local storage. We do not use cloud storage, and your data remains private and secure, accessible only by you. 

Permissions We Request

1. activeTab: This permission allows the extension to fetch the current tab’s URL to create a bookmark. It is used solely for capturing the active tab’s URL when you decide to save it as a bookmark.
  
2. storage: This permission grants the extension access to local storage to save and retrieve your bookmark data, categories, tags, and notes.

3. downloads: This permission enables the extension to allow you to download a backup of your saved bookmark data. This backup can be stored locally on your device and restored later if needed.

We do not request any other permissions that are not necessary to the core functionality of the extension.

Data Retention

Your data, including bookmarks, categories, tags, and notes, is stored indefinitely on your device unless you manually delete it. If you decide to download a backup of your bookmark data, we will store the data in a local file that can be accessed or restored later.

Third-Party Services

Bookmarks-plus does not integrate with any third-party services or share any data with external parties. All data is stored locally on your device, ensuring your information remains private and under your control.

Security

We take the security of your data seriously. Since your data is stored locally and not sent to external servers, there is minimal risk of unauthorized access. However, it is essential to ensure that your device is secure and protected from unauthorized access.

Your Rights

As the user, you have full control over your data. You can export your bookmarks and delete them at any time. We do not collect or track any personal information, and all data remains on your device.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the extension’s features or privacy practices. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates. If any significant changes are made, we will notify users through the extension or provide an updated version of the Privacy Policy.
